Get us a new Mayor that knows what they are doing!,
"I love our tree planting initiative--it's a great start! We ought to be recycling more and giving tax breaks to those businesses that promote recycling, sell recycled or upcycled goods. Why are we not doing curbside glass recycling?  Glass is not dangerous to our bodies and the environment (unlike endocrine disrupters like some plastics) and we should be using it more--not less.   In terms of composting, we should encourage neighborhood gardens (and possibly recycling areas) to develop compost to use in the garden. We should work with our county libraries to develop a lending library for things like wood chippers and chain saws so residents can then use plant debris for composting.  Become early adopters of a system to decompose plastic, see science article from Yale students: http://bit.ly/3pAOgUE  ",
"Promote traditional family values of caring for one another, supporting one another, being kind to one another.  We often talk about mitigation strategies but kindness is a mitigation strategy that is very often overlooked.  If everyone were a bit kinder we would see less litter, more sharing of resources, less waste, and more concern for one another and their overall well being and quality of life.  Please promote traditional family values such as kindness, courtesy, tolerance, and love.",
"Institute funding programs (loan/grant like Tucson Water rainwater harvesting) for low-income families to install roof-top solar Work to change laws/regulationss instituted to benefit TEP, APS, SRP to disadvantage of individuals regarding solar power Institute program for Tucson employees - revolving loan - to upgrade/mitigate homes (like State of Nevada program)",
Increase taxes/fees on persons who own more than one vehicle.,
Require TEP to allow net metering for all roof top solar installations.,
Call Phoenix.,
"Use excess gas build up from the landfill that I see being burned off frequently, to fuel a power station.",
"Stop building new residences and apartments. Period. Want there a âshow you can support the population with water for 100yrsâ law?  Key point is this, stop making this a vacation spot. People come for 4mos, donât respect our limited resources (water) or city and leave without contributing anything back.  I suggest raising taxes for non-permanent residents, with tax breaks for those who commit to civil service while here. (Trail work, bike path maint, social/homeless fixes-majority of migration is likely duringâ winterâ when the vacations are here.  Utilize them!)  Lastly, water restrictions.  No reason we are planting new grass, citrus and palm trees.  This isnât Florida, planet native!!  City has a water harvesting program, if people desire high-water plants, then force them into it.  Make it the individualâs money/maint/choice, not the taxpayers!  This is the big one, control the water and you control the out of control building and farming (cotton?) practices.",
"Single-use plastic bag reduction, elimination or ban. LIkely a small fee per bag at checkout. Making downtown Congress St or 4th AVE a pedestrian zone to get away from car culture. ",
Make the book âLast Child in the Woodsâ required reading of all mayor/council members to better understand the effects of reduced green spaces on learning and development of children and adults as well as overall health and well being.,
Green New Deal!,
"Climate change, the Paris Accords, et al are simply wealth redistribution programs for the Elite.",
Water harvesting & green infrastructure.   ,
More green spaces. More trees. Convert city golf courses to open space parks for the public. More trees. More trees please. ,
Convert closed Schools into green areaâs ,
No wind programs-kills birds Solar needs more efficient not so costly and low benefit to cost ration- research dollars to University of az,
"We need to protect vulnerable populations and vulnerable ecosystems. Conserving more open space is essential. Enhancing green spaces in the city and making them more accessible. Limit growth at periphery of city, increase density near core and services. ",
Focus on job building and the people of this city. There are other countries with far worse climate initiatives that could be addressed above the US.,
No - it seems you have covered all.,
This is a great list and starting point - including these efforts with robust and meaningful participation from residents would really seal the deal for me.,
"The City of Tucson is doing an extremely poor job at addressing homelessness with their policies; that should be the #1 priority for the sake of the community and safety of those living on the streets.  Additionally, policies and regulations regarding small businesses who make and serve food will only increase the costs to those business, who will in turn pass those on to their customers.  This increase costs to customers will only make it less accessible to low-income customers.",
I believe we have the responsibility to care of EXISTING community members with a focus on education.  Reading writing and arithmetic.   We need to address that they have comfortable homes and know how to take of them.  This needs to be fixed instead of adding to problems ,
"We should focus on expanding opportunities for cooperative business models. Bad for the local economy if surplus-value and profits are being outsourced. A specific tax reduction for co-ops would help them grow and expand without having to directly compete with corporate entities. I would also suggest the Preston-model which is a localized economic model first tried in Preston, UK that seeks to maintain wealth and profits in the city. Was very succesful.",
The political issues need to be removed from this type of program.,
"Have more programs like Las Milpitas that's through the Food Bank. While there are community gardens around town, they are expensive and not very accessible. Promoting local food production for individual households will improve food security and reduce our community's carbon footprint. ",
"Maintaining higher quality indoor air standards for schools, especially in low income areas, would be great. Building maintenance, proper upkeep of HVAC systems, enhanced air filtration and ventilation etc. I know some indoor environmental quality experts that could perhaps be talked to.",
Why tree planting and cool pavement in low income neighborhoods. Should be city wide. ,
infusing sustainability into city employees first and most.....set an example.  ,
This could include anyone moving to AZ to avoid winters. Maybe it needs a wordsmith.,
"I don't know what category this fits under but grass lawns and golf courses don't belong in a desert. At the very least, they should be made to use grey water. I don't know of a sport that's more ridiculously ill-suited for this environment.",
China changes out electric car batteries at changing stations which eliminates waiting long periods to charge and the need for a huge number of charging stations.  Roller shields and solar tube lighting should be promoted.,
Recall Regina Romero.,
"(1) Use NACTO Green Stormwater Infrastructure guidelines to develop concepts for any transit and mobility project. These concepts might not be present in the final version of every project, but it's important for Tucson residents to see what's given up in exchange for more pavement.  (2) Follow Sacramento's lead and allow development of four-plexes on any property already zoned for single-family housing. Tucson needs more housing with less sprawl and shorter commutes. Less sprawl and shorter commutes mean more green space and fewer emissions.  (3) Replace mandated parking minimums with mandated parking maximums â over the long-term, this will reduce urban heat islands and allow for more efficient infill development that reduces driving distances and emissions.  (4) Consistently review development plans and city real estate transactions against the Pima County Master Trails Plan. It's much easier to establish trail easements and other necessities before rezoning and project approval than after âÂ this will allow more green infrastructure to be developed more quickly.  (5) Move from mobility-based (vehicle throughput) to accessibility-based (average trip time) transportation planning if Tucson DTM has not already done so. Slower-moving traffic is acceptable if both trip times and emissions are reduced.  (6) City of Tucson should formally adopt the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan. SDCP provides a reasonably good mechanism for protection of critical green space, or, failing that, mitigation of development effects.  (7) Development projects are reviewed against Plan Tucson for compatibility with the city's long-term vision. The successor to Plan Tucson might place greater emphasis on climate mitigation. It could also take the locally unprecedented step of describing the attributes of incompatible developments. In one recent instance, the complete encasement of an arroyo (along with the destruction of its green space) was allowed because of a single sentence buried deep within a PAD planning document. Once approved, PAD planning documents give developers enormous latitude âÂ this privilege should require two concomitant responsibilities for developers: (a) to affirm that plans comport with a set of guidelines, and (b) deny that the plans include any proscribed actions.",
"Drought resistant landscaping cannot be a yard of rocks. This needs to be discouraged. We need plants and trees. Many people move here from other states where they mowed lawns for their whole lives and they want no vegetation in their yard.  This should not be allowed.  We need job training for people to get good jobs in the water harvesting field (installing gutters, cisterns, basins, and gray water, etc.). Urban forestry is a good idea, but water harvesting jobs will be more needed and probably pay more. There are a lot of people who call themselves landscapers and few will know the difference between someone trained in urban forestry and they will be competing with nurseries and landscapers, which there are  lot of already.  Houses need to be built with plumbing for city water and gray water. I should be able to take a bath or shower and have the water go onto my trees instead of into the sewer, assuming eco friendly soaps are used. All sinks should have foot pedals or water activated by waving your hand to reduce water consumption.  We need more trash and recycling cans to promote people throwing their own trash in these cans and not on the ground. We need recycling cans and cigarette butt containers at each bus stop and at each trash can. This city is very trashy and it's not surprising because there is nowhere to throw the trash when you are walking, except on the ground, unless you are a responsible individual. Many people aren't and hence we have an enormous amount of trash.  We cannot be converting everything to electric if the utility company is a for profit company. The City needs to do business with a non-profit and reduce the cost of electricity or control any price increase to the bare minimum. It is not fare to anyone to be held captive by a for profit company.",
I know it's in there but please create green job corps.,
Electric appliances are inefficient. The most efficient use of energy is natural gas at the home. Electricity has line loss and it takes more production for the same energy at the end point. Natural is a clean alternative to other energy sources. It is affordable for low income families. Electricity is expensive,
"How about promoting wider use of reclaimed water in ALL new construction residential projects AND providing residential customers who utilize reclaimed water with an annual rebate or tax deduction?  Currently, I pay an additional fee for reclaimed water.  I do so because I care about the environment but many of my neighbors do not participate because of the added expense associated with the service and maintenance fees.",
"incorporating quality transit improvements (roundabouts over signaled intersections, transit over new lane-miles/parking) must be prioritized at every step, every project, start with brt/lrt on the sunshine mile.",
"promote education and rebates for homeowners interested in converting swimming pools to water harvesting, gardening or other water saving measures.",
"The roads here are awful...put funding into the infrastructure. If this is your plan, Tucson will continue to be an economic wasteland dependent on the UA and DM (which will probably close).",
I am. And I am a single parent of a young child. Please offer opportunities that are also child friendly (even when there is not a pandemic).,
"I am close to retirement age and when I retire I'm interested in working on affordable housing projects, working on making city code friendlier for alternative building (net zero carbon), urban farming cooperatives, alternative investments (why SHOULDN""T Tucson offer public/private investment portfolios designed to draw investments away from unstable Wall Street junk investments?)  Just a few changes in our local and state laws could supercharge private investment funds coming to this City to make very bid, very amazing changes to our local investment environment.  https://michaelhshuman.com/   I would say our biggest problem is not lack of talent at the grassroots. It is lack of visionary leadership and COURAGE in political leadership...because all of these ideas represent a threat to somebody's business model.  It takes courage and imagination and vision to see PAST that, to see into a future where even the 'good ole boys' will wake up to an expanded understanding of how freeing universal prosperity can be. Its like the movie Monster's INC where the monsters suddenly realized that they were only getting 1/1000th the energy from making kids scream in fear when they could make them laugh with delight.  ",

I am interested in only shopping at local businesses that use recyclables or have zero-waste goals. ,
I would love to be a part of city-wide composting efforts,
We already do this.,
"Yes, I am happy to drive the Mayor and all the County Supervisors across the border to shit hole Mexico and/or Taxifornia.  GET THE HELL OUT OF GOVERNMENT, you people suck",
Green new deal is a fraud. Follow the money   Wise up before it is too late. Donât get suckered into the hype. Follow the money. ,
"End all publicity and support for the ""growth at any cost"" attitude of developers, builders, and mines. Stop pushing the commercially based idea that everyone should spend their whole indoor lives at a steady 72 degrees.  Stop promoting population growth as the measure of community success. Id like to see Tucson developed and promoted as an example of what can be done to live sustainably --especially with regard to water use.  Why not make that ""who we are"" and take pride in it?  Come follow me around as I take the bucket of water I collected while waiting for the hot water to get to the shower outside to dump around the new little tree I planted directly north and west of the living room windows.  ",
Recall Regina Romero ,
Go big or go home. This is the time that will determine if Tucson will thrive or become a victim of Climate Change.,
The opportunities mentioned above should be a headline in local papers every single day. It should be really easy information to find. ,
"This survey is great - keep in mind the many people without online access, who might be underrepresented.",
Local First Arizona's Southern Arizona Green Business Leaders ,
"Thank you for the opportunity to provide critical feedback about climate adaptation to climate change for Tucson. I am impressed with the array of thoughts/ideas presented in this survey. I would like to draw attention to Tucson being a ""city of renters"" and with such, consideration of the aforementioned opportunities and planning items being applicable towards rental situation -- with both the property owner and tenants alike. ",
"Expand concrete and tire recycling. Replace antiquated sewer treatment plants with remote efficient treatment systems, currently available, affordable and extremely efficient with a 90 percent drinking water recovery. Remote systems will eliminate long sewer line runs and maintenance and can be operated remotely and run on solar panels. ",
"We all want a clean environment, but let the free market do it!",
"Tucson's carbon footprint is virtually zero, when compared to China and India.  Do not impose additional financial burdens on tax payers for appearances' sake.  ",
continued population growth in southern Arizona is not compatible with a reduced water supply.,
