Planting shade trees along city walks to reduce temp. Changing roads from black asphalt to something lighter and less heat retaining.,Positivo
Tucson for the most part is not walkable. What can be done to encourage less personal auto use while also looking at safety (I am astounded at the number of accidents with pedestrian involvement disgraceful).,Negativo
"Tree planting, green space, restrict new development that requires new water use",Positivo
"Truly, it seems that vehicle pollution in Tucson is a major problem affected the quality of air we breathe on a daily basis.",Positivo
"Encouraging and promoting alternative forms of ""green"" transportation throughout the city, and effectively marketing these alternatives, will help people to reach destinations, without polluting the environment.",Positivo
More walkable spaces. Completely close some streets to cars. Make bicycle and walking spaces the priority over vehicle traffic in many areas.,Positivo
"Support green job industries and training programs through adult education programs and JTED/CTE, Community college, and university courses.",Positivo
Insulation Community or city large scale solar rather than only on rooftops Water efficiency programs to save on energy emissions for pumping and pools Pretty much everything proposed by Project Drawdown (drawdown.org),Positivo
Fix all the streets and roads and then you can work on other stuff.,Positivo
Take care of the parks and recreation areas that you do not maintain.,Positivo
Stop doing feel good stuff and hire more police to take care of the poor service in Tucson.,Positivo
"This is where all our money should go, improving Tucson's quality of life.",Positivo
"Rain water catchment throughout urban landscape, in parks (to use for plant watering), at city buildings (for indoor water use), at golf courses, riverways.",Positivo
Along major road corridors we could add solar roof tunnels to catch sun and divert rain to catchment sources. control personal home water use allowances.,Positivo
Fine for grass or landscaping water use incl at golf courses. We don't have enough water and need to be aggressive about protecting its usage. ,Negativo
"Aside from vehicular emissions, heating/cooling residences will be a huge opportunity to reduce energy consumption. We need to create strong incentives for people to have energy efficiency work done on existing structures.",Positivo
I think there should be state tax credits available for this work - similar to credits available in other states or at the federal level for electric vehicle purchase or installation of charger infrastructure.,Negativo
What does your race have to do with climate change. I look forward to the sun and heat so I can get a nice tan,Negativo
Mismanagement of our national forests is a huge cause for the increase of wildfires.,Negativo
We have got to stop wasting water. Tucson will be a ghost town if we run out of water. Let's start with changing our toilet habits to dry composting. Or flush toilets with waste water from sink/showers.,Positivo
All buildings with water catching gutters and containers to slow water planted areas. Get rid of the heat bubble of black tar and asphalt.,Negativo
Investing in a green infrastructure will result in jobs which will help the economy.,Negativo
More abundant public education on climate change and economic and quality of life co-benefits of mitigating and adapting to climate change.,Positivo
"More robust public awareness campaigns during extreme heat season. Better drought emergency preparednes, put in mandatory measures at lower drought stages, to better prepare Tucson residents for potential water shortages.",Positivo
Far more extensive public involvement in climate change planning. Enhanced city-county cooperation and coordination on climate planning. Don't count on tree planting as a panacea.,Positivo
What does provide benefits to historically disadvantaged groups mean? Racial equity for the environment? Unclear of how this is implemented or how it would impact any decisions being made.,Negativo
Need residential solar subsidies and more smaller housing options around 1100-1500 sq feet (not multi-family),Positivo
The City needs more open green spaces where trees can grow. Our green space % is awful. This greening would reduce the heat island effect. The domino of lowering our cooling energy needs which lowers polluting emissions from power.,Positivo
"Water is the #1 long term concern, but not due to this. We need a state wide solution. Look to Israel. We need to take Phoenix's waste water, treat it and have farmers irrigate with that instead of the potable water they steal.",Positivo
"Have a volunteer base who can help teach these strategies, so they can apply them within the community.",Positivo
"Have a volunteer group receiving AZ benefits such as unemployment, be required to learn and implement some of these strategies within our city.",Positivo
"Explain why things are being changed, to create buy-in from the community. ",Positivo
"A resource used is a resource used, no matter who uses it. It is imperative that we are affording the same equities and opportunities to underrepresented groups as to majority groups.",Negativo
"In equity can we all tackle climate and resilience challenges in a united and effective front. In addition, I strongly encourage implementing food waste reduction plans to simultaneously reduce demands on landfills while feeding those in need.",Positivo
"Also, I support tree planting/re-greening but must emphasize it be planned in collaboration with ecologists/botanists so that a) appropriate species and b) appropriate localities for growth be maximized.",Positivo
The city of Tucson must provide support to their legal citizens before supporting programs for refugees and illegal immigrants,Negativo
"Our homelessness issues are more complex than supporting affordable housing. Increased mental health/public health options for the homeless need to be available. Also, public showers, places where people can get clean clothes, counciling, etc.",Positivo
"Step 1: Transparency, honesty and equity in the bid and contracting process for all departments. ",Positivo
Reverse descrimation is still descrimination and just as wrong as any descriminating!,Positivo
"Have more programs like Las Milpitas that's through the Food Bank. While there are community gardens around town, they are expensive and not very accessible.",Positivo
Promoting local food production for individual households will improve food security and reduce our community's carbon footprint. ,Positivo
"The City should be careful of trying to solve all problems for the disadvantaged. Many services are successfully provided by NGOs/non-profits. It is not the City's role to be a social service agency, nor to play Robin Hood.",Negativo
"I support human development, not segregated development. We are all one on this planet and anyone trying to put us against each other is not for human kind but for him or her self. We have to stop the madness of bashing each other and come together for a great Tucson future.",Positivo
Affordability. We need to protect the most vulnerable populations by providing affordable essential services. You cannot just charge people so much for energy. Rooftop solar is great. It's also very expensive.,Positivo
My natural gas bill is consistently the most inexpensive bill I get. Why aren't there more questions on affordability?,Negativo
Low income neighborhoods should not be the only focus of tree-planting and cool roof/pavements. This is a city wide proplemsand ALL areas of Tucson need to be implemented with these infrastructures. Why would this include only low income areas?,Positivo
Stop planting palo verde trees in the city because many people are allergic to them.,Negativo
"What do you mean by ""promote""? Offering tax incentives? Again, your language is so incredibly fuzzy. I see this as more of the same government rhetoric designed to make it look like someone is doing something, to make it possible to have meetings, committees, and papers written, to get publicity, and to accomplish absolutely nothing for the people.",Negativo
Work with HOAs that require plants to either reduce required number of plants and/or promote desert plants that do not use much water.,Positivo
More regulation on golf courses that are using large amounts of water. Reduce cost of solar panels. Work with HOAs to promote use of solar panels.,Positivo
China changes out electric car batteries at changing stations which eliminates waiting long periods to charge and the need for a huge number of charging stations. Roller shields and solar tube lighting should be promoted.,Positivo
"The best way a government can facilitate equity in a society is by providing an excellent public education to every one. Not only K-12 but also community college. They should be subsidized by the government so that the society will have the types of workers it will need in the present and future, whether it is a construction occupation, a computer tech, or a medical role, and so that young people may find productive ways to make a living.",Positivo
it seems to me that the reason some parts of town are so barren is that the residents are low income and do not have the disposable income to use to pay for more than the bare minimum of water,Positivo
I don't see how a massive tree planting program for the city can ever be successful until a solution for this problem is found.,Negativo
Maybe start with drought adapted native street trees that are watered at city expense? or charge low income residents low water fees if they plant desert trees?,Positivo
No grass orpine trees,Negativo
Legalize and promote humanure (composting of human waste on site rather than flushing 10 gallons of precious drinking water a day!),Positivo
"green buildings (living walls, rooftop gardens, local energy production, local water and energy reuse)",Positivo
"Please discourage planting green grass in a desert and stop planting new green grass in unnecessary places. Green grass is awful, non-native and uses so much water.",Positivo
"Native landscaping uses much less water, and still provides cooling effects, CO2 exchange and shade.",Positivo
"1. Recycling and composting: I do recycle plastic (as allowed), newspapers, office paper, mailings, cardboard. I also am collecting glass to take to the Ward 6 office for recycling. And I take my grocery store plastic bags back to the grocery store in case they really do recycle them.",Positivo
"I do not compost because I don't have a use for it. I'm concerned that a city-wide compost pick-up system would end up with a lot of non-compostable waste, cause problems with some of our urban wildlife such as javelinas, and not be picked up often enough. ",Positivo
"If there was a place close to me that I could take compostable waste (food waste, yard waste) and that place was open several days a week -- I would collect my compostable waste and take it there. I think the UA Compost Cats had a place that one can take compost -- but it looks as if is shut down.",Positivo
This website makes it look as if Compost Cats is now partnering with the City somehow and that some special people can take their waste to someplace or other. What about expanding this? And advertising it in the water bill? https://sustainability.arizona.edu/projects/compost-cats,Negativo
"2. Restaurants and take-out -- it would be GREAT if the City would encourage restaurants and take out places to use compostable containers. During this pandemic, I am trying to support the local restaurants that I used to go to for sit-down dining, coffee, etc. (and want to continue to go to!). However, the containers the food comes in is often styrofoam or plastic containers.",Positivo
"I don't have a use for the styrofoam cups and containers -- and I am drowning in lidded plastic containers. I wish I knew of a place to give the plastic containers away -- I have way more than I need to store food, keep leftovers, etc. And putting those reusable plastic containers into the recycle seems a terrible waste.",Positivo
3. E-scooters litter the landscape and sidewalks and are not a good solution for many of us. Expand the light-rail. Improve the bus service and advertise it.,Negativo
"4. Buses -- FIX the shade structures at bus stops. Have you looked at those upside-down umbrellas at bus stops along the expanded Grant Road project west of First/Euclid? Whenever I pass them, there is NO SHADE under them. Stop installing non-functioning architectural wonders by bus stops and put in real shade structures instead.",Positivo
"Those blue coated-metal shade structures DO provide shade for much of the day. Think about revising those or re-orienting them so they offer shade throughout the day. If you want to increase bus ridership, do something so people don't bake in our desert sun while they wait for the bus.",Positivo
I feel this whole survey and the mayor's attempts to give government too much space in our lives is not at all beneficial to Tucsonans. Most of these issues should not be addressed by government.,Negativo
I believe that climate change is a farce (whatever happened to the science?) and I resent the mayor's attempts to make everything into a race issue. America is not a communist country and this is what this mayor wants for us.,Negativo
"There is a legal method of entering the United States and this mayor encourages sanctuary cities etc, showing her complete disregard for the Constitution and American citizens.",Negativo
"Trees require too much water and the roots impact sewer lines. Food and waste is needed in our garbage to promote the breakdown of garbage in our landfills. I will put solar panels in when the lightweight, as thin as a piece of tinfoil, inexpensive panels become available.",Negativo
I would like to see the commuter cars China has that are small battery powered cars promoted.,Negativo
Programs that help residents and commercial owners reduce water use.,Negativo
I do my own part. All other citizens and businesses should do their own part as best they can.,Negativo
My wife and I are both handicapped seniors,Negativo
I live in Barrio Viejo and would love to see all of the above. We need sidewalks/walking paths and shade. A community garden with rentable plots like in other cities would be welcomed.,Positivo
i would like to make a green space in the facinity of my own home and take responsibility into my own hands,Positivo
I will vote for whomever has the strongest most intelligent approach to preparing us for environmental disaster BEFORE it happens.,Positivo
"I already have solar panels, I have several citrus trees and many rose bushes. I do what I can",Positivo
Water is a much bigger problem than this survey really allowed for. Please take into account the reality of our overuse of water and the decreasing availability of it there wont be more for us to take eg from the Colorado,Positivo
"I'm not suggesting just the low hanging fruit, but do celebrate and publicize any successes. Tucson is a complex community with residents of many backgrounds, levels of education, age, income, ethnicity and other variables.",Negativo
"Sadly, the whole country is polarized with some people rejecting climate science. The City's effort will need to be nuanced and inclusive. Good luck.  ",Negativo
"Hiring and training landscape crews that know how to properly prune native trees and shrubs, maintain native landscape and identify native plants.",Positivo
Thank you for implementing this! I am very appreciative! I look forward in getting involved.,Positivo
"Common sense is hard to find. Reuse Phoenix waste water, plant trees, harvest sun and rain, electrify bus routes (no batteries). Don't put on a super hero cape and roll out disastrous policies in the name of the environment.",Negativo
Why do HOA's have more authority than the City?,Negativo
Thank you for the survey.,Positivo
Thank you for your progressive policies. This is one of the big reasons why I decided to move my family to Tucson.,Positivo
"Keep using social media to promote existing COT rebate and other programs, it's an easy way to get the word out. Thank you for planning for our future. People and Planet - not profit!",Positivo
