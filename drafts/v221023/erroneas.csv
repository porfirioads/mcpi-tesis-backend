i look forward to the sun and heat so i can get a nice tan
mismanagement of our national forests is a huge cause for the increase of wildfires

the best way a government can facilitate equity in a society is by providing an excellent public education to every one  not only k 12 but also community college  they should be subsidized by the government so that the society will have the types of workers it will need in the present and future, whether it is a construction occupation, a computer tech, or a medical role, and so that young people may find productive ways to make a living
no grass orpine trees
trees require too much water and the roots impact sewer lines
food and waste is needed in our garbage to promote the breakdown of garbage in our landfills
i live in barrio viejo and would love to see all of the above
i would like to make a green space in the facinity of my own home and take responsibility into my own hands
i m not suggesting just the low hanging fruit, but do celebrate and publicize any successes  tucson is a complex community with residents of many backgrounds, levels of education, age, income, ethnicity and other variables  sadly, the whole country is polarized with some people rejecting climate science  the city s effort will need to be nuanced and inclusive  good luck
common sense is hard to find  reuse phoenix waste water, plant trees, harvest sun and rain, electrify bus routes  no batteries
thank you for your progressive policies  this is one of the big reasons why i decided to move my family to tucson
keep using social media to promote existing cot rebate and other programs, it s an easy way to get the word out  thank you for planning for our future  people and planet   not profit!
gratitude for the survey and the efforts of mayor and council
